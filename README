***** ABOUT *****
This package contains these applets:
	- Window Buttons Applet
	- Window Title Applet
GNOME Panel applets that substitute the maximized window toolbar.
I decided to make this because GNOME violates Fitts's Law by putting
a panel between the maxed window buttons and the corner of the screen.
These applets were designed to solve the problem.
